Chashir Hasi project has successfully culminated in a fully functional e-commerce platform 
built on the Laravel framework. The application effectively addresses the identified challenges in the 
Bangladeshi online marketplace, namely a deficit of consumer trust and significant logistical 
hurdles. Through a meticulously designed database schema and a modular software architecture, the 
platform provides a robust solution for managing products, processing orders, and facilitating a 
nationwide delivery network. The implementation demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of 
full-stack web development, integrating a user-friendly frontend with a powerful backend that
